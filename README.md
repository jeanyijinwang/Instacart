# Instacart 

This repo shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks that I used to analyze Instacart dataset with over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.

Here are the two notebooks:

- Data Exploration: Exploring the raw datasets.
- Customer Segmentation: Segmenting the customers with Principal Component Analysis and K-means Clustering.
