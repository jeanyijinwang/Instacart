# Instacart 

This repo shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks that I used to analyze Instacart dataset with over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.
Check the Data Descriptions [here](https://github.com/jeanyijinwang/Instacart/blob/master/data_description.md)!

Here are the two notebooks:

- [Data Exploration](https://github.com/jeanyijinwang/Instacart/blob/master/notebooks/Instacart%20EDA.ipynb): Exploring the raw datasets.
- [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/jeanyijinwang/Instacart/blob/master/notebooks/Customer%20Segments.ipynb): Segmenting the customers with Principal Component Analysis and K-means Clustering.
